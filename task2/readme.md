  Starting task 2 without vBuddy (Troy has it). Unable to do part 1 now so will continue to part 2, so I dont need to waste any time on it.
  It was suprisingly easy to follow. Though that's probably because I'm going to skip task 3 and 4. Managed to follow the logic of each step and modify the
  testbench accordingly. Commented each part i need to come back and understand it.
